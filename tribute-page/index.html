                <li>The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace—better known as
                    "Ada Lovelace"—was born in London on December 10, 1815.</li>

                <li>Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron, was the only legitimate child of the famous poet Lord George
                    Gordon Byron. Lord Byron's marriage to Ada's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron, was not a happy
                    one. Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks after their daughter was born. A few months later,
                    Lord Byron left England, and Ada never saw her father again. He died in Greece when Ada was 8 years
                    old.</li>

                <li>Ada had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence,
                    tutors taught her mathematics and science. Such challenging subjects were not standard fare for women
                    at the time, but her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent Lovelace from
                    developing her father's moody and unpredictable temperament. Ada was also forced to lie still for
                    extended periods of time because her mother believed it would help her develop self-control.</li>

                <li>Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. The pair became friends,
                    and the much older Babbage served as a mentor to Ada. Through Babbage, Ada began studying advanced
                    mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de Morgan.</li>

                <li>Ada was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of the computer, he invented the difference
                    engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Ada got a chance to look at the machine
                    before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage also created plans for another device known
                    as the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex calculations.</li>

                <li>Ada was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by
                    Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the original
                    French text into English, but also added her own thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up
                    being three times longer than the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in an English
                    science journal. Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.</li>

                <li>In her notes, Ada described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols
                    along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a
                    process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking
                    concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.</li>

                <li>Ada's article attracted little attention when she was alive. In her later years, she tried to develop
                    mathematical schemes for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and put her in
                    financial peril.</li>
                <li>Ada died from uterine cancer in London on November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the
                    graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham, England.</li>
